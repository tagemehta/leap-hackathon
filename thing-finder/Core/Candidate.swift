//  Created by Cascade AI on 2025-07-13.
//
//  Value-type model representing an object candidate currently being tracked
//  in the per-frame detection pipeline.  The struct is intentionally free of
//  ARKit-specific concepts (e.g. anchors) so it works for both AVFoundation and
//  ARKit capture modes.
//
//  This file contains **no** business logic – only the data container.  All
//  mutation happens through `CandidateStore` helpers to keep thread-safety via
//  main-queue publishes.
